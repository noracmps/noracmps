# About Me

Hello! I'm Nora Campos, a passionate software engineering student on a journey to master the exciting world of programming. Here's a bit more about me:

## My Interests

- **Programming Languages:** Currently, I'm focused on learning programming languages: **CSS**, **C#** and **JavaScript**. I'm fascinated by how these languages can be used to create applications both on the server and client sides, and I'm excited about the opportunities they offer.

- **Software Engineering:** I'm studying software engineering at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Occidente. My goal is to deeply understand the principles and practices of software engineering to develop efficient, high-quality software solutions.

## My Background

Before embarking on my software engineering journey, I was a chemical engineering student. However, I decided to change paths because what truly ignited my passion was the world of programming. 

## What Inspires Me

What inspires me the most in the world of programming is the ability to create practical solutions for real-world problems. I'm thrilled about the opportunity to work on challenging projects and collaborate with fellow developers to build innovative software that makes a difference.
